class ModelService(Service):
    """
        This service acts as the primary data store in your cloud. It manages
        the records of a single model by listening for actions that indicate
        a record mutation as well as emitting actions when the mutations have
        finished (whether successfully or not). The external API is
        automatically generated to match the given model.

        Args:
            model (nautilus.BaseModel): The nautilus model to manage.
            additonal_action_handler (optional, function): An action handler
                to be called alongside the internal ones.

        Example:

            .. code-block:: python

                from nautilus import ModelService
                from sqlalchemy import Column, Text
                from nautilus.models import HasID, BaseModel, CRUDNotificationCreator


                # these mixins provide make the model "live". For more information,
                # see foo_bar.
                class Model(CRUDNotificationCreator, HasID, BaseModel):
                    name = Column(Text)


                class ServiceConfig:
                    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'sqlite:////tmp/models.db'
