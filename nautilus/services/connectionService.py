    """
        This service manages a connection between any number of other services.
        The underlying schema and database are automatically generated to
        match the primary keys of the linked services.

        This service will listen for actions indicating the deletion of a related
        model and remove any related fields to maintain consistency. And provides
        a way for the api gateway to deduce the relationship between services when
        summarizing the cloud.

        Args:
            services (list of nautilus.Service): The list of services to connect.
            additonal_action_handler (optional, function): An action handler
                to be called alongside the internal ones.

        Example:

            .. code-block:: python

                # external imports
                import nautilus

                # the services to connect
