class Connection(Field):
    """
        A field that encapsultes a connection with another GraphQL object.

        Args:

            target (string or ObjectType): The target object type. If target is a
                SerivceObjectType then the remote data lookup is automated using the
                target object's meta service attribute.

            relationship (string: "one" or "many"): The kind of relationship that this
                connection encapsultes. If set to "many" the connection will result in
                a list whereas if it is set to "one" the connection will result in the
                object type itself.


        Example:

            For an example, see the getting started guide.
