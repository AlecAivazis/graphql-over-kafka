Welcome to Nautilus!
=====================

Nautilus is a framework for building secure, event-driven microservices and
attempts to provide extendible implementations of common aspects of a moden
web application so that you can focus on what you do best: building awesome,
scalable services. Some of these features include:

    * Distributed authentication
    * Message passing
    * Couple-free service joins
    * Service API versioning (coming soon!)
    * A flexible GraphQL API that adapts as services come online
    * Distributed/remote database administration (coming soon!)


At the moment, there is only a python implementation of the general architecture,
but there are plans for more languages - stay tuned!
